# Number Guessing Game

This repository contains the solution for the **Build a Number Guessing Game** project. This is one of the required projects to earn your certification in Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git from freeCodeCamp. The goal of this project is to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal, saves user information, and uses PostgreSQL for data storage.

## Project Overview

1. A **Bash script** (`number_guess.sh`) is used to create a terminal-based number guessing game.
2. **PostgreSQL** is used to save user information, including game history and high scores.
3. The project is developed in a virtual Linux environment using **Gitpod**.
